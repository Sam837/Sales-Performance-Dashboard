## Problem Background
`A Portuguese bank uses direct marketing campaigns to promote financial products such as term deposits, which are crucial for securing stable funding. However, cold calling and broad-based outreach often lead to low conversion rates, wasting resources and missing potential customers. By analyzing past campaign data—including customer demographics, economic indicators, and call details—the bank can develop a predictive model to prioritize clients more likely to subscribe, thereby improving efficiency and profitability.`

`The Portuguese banking institution aims to improve the effectiveness of its direct marketing campaigns by increasing the subscription rate for term deposits. The primary objective of this project is to improve the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns for a Portuguese banking institution. The analysis focuses on understanding which customer demographics and campaign features are most likely to lead to a term deposit subscription. By identifying these patterns, the project aims to help the bank increase its subscription rate by at least 3% within a month.`


## Project Output
`The primary output of this project is to analyze and find out a way to increase term deposit subscription such as:`

`- Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns and insights.`
    `- Visualizations: Charts and graphs (histograms, bar plots, box plots) to illustrate trends and patterns.`
    `- Statistical Analysis: Tests to validate hypotheses.`

`- Develop a sales performance dashboard to visualize key metrics.`

`- Provide strategic recommendations to optimize future marketing campaigns.`

## Data
`The dataset used for this analysis contains information on phone-call-based direct marketing campaigns. It includes various customer attributes such as:`

`- Demographics: age, job, marital status, education`

`- Financial: default status, average yearly balance, housing loan status`

`- Campaign-related: contact method, last contact day and month, duration of contact, number of contacts during this campaign`

`The raw_dataset.csv file, which uses a semicolon (;) as a delimiter, was cleaned and processed into cleaned_data.csv for the analysis.`


## Method
`The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. The methodology includes:'

`- **Data Cleaning:** The raw data was cleaned to handle inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.`

`- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The cleaned data was analyzed to identify trends related to demographics, contact methods, and campaign outcomes.`

`- **Data Visualization:** A comprehensive dashboard was created to present key insights and performance metrics visually.`

`- **Recommendations:** Based on the findings, strategic recommendations were developed to improve future campaign effectiveness.`

## Stacks
`The project uses the following tools and libraries:`

`- **Python:** The primary programming language for the analysis.`

`- **Jupyter Notebook:** The environment where the analysis and dashboard were developed.`

`- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and cleaning.`

`- **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations.`

`- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.`
