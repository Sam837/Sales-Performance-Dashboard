# Project Title
`This program that prepares and processes a dataset from a Portuguese banking institution that contains information about direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution from www.archive.ics.uci.edu. The purpose of this program is to analyze and find out a way to increase term deposit subscription.`

## Problem Background
`A Portuguese bank uses direct marketing campaigns to promote financial products such as term deposits, which are crucial for securing stable funding. However, cold calling and broad-based outreach often lead to low conversion rates, wasting resources and missing potential customers. By analyzing past campaign data—including customer demographics, economic indicators, and call details—the bank can develop a predictive model to prioritize clients more likely to subscribe, thereby improving efficiency and profitability.`

`The Portuguese banking institution aims to improve the effectiveness of its direct marketing campaigns by increasing the subscription rate for term deposits. Currently, the campaigns rely on phone calls, but the conversion rate is suboptimal. The goal is to leverage historical marketing data to identify high-propensity customers and refine targeting strategies to increase the subscription rate by 3% within one month.`


## Project Output
`The primary output of this project is to analyze and find out a way to increase term deposit subscription such as:`

`- Visualizations: Charts and graphs (histograms, bar plots, box plots) to illustrate trends and patterns.`

`- Statistical Analysis: Tests to validate hypotheses.`

`- Dashboard: Interactive elements to explore the data and insights.`

## Data
`The dataset apartments_for_rent_classified_100K.csv contains information about apartments available for rent.`

`Overall, it has 14 categoricals Dtype and 8 numericals Dtype with 14 strings, 5 floats, and 3 integers. There are 11 columns with missing values:'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'price', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'amenities', 'pets_allowed', 'price_display', 'address', 'cityname', & 'state' columns`


## Method
`In this Apartment Rental Price Prediction project, We used a Random Forest Regression model, comparing both untuned (default parameters) and tuned (hyperparameter-optimized) versions. Other models were also in used KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.`

## Stacks
`I am using python on VS Code and Huggingface to visualize the data. I am also using libraries python: pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, Pipeline, RandomForestRegressor, etc.. to help me modelization, analyze and visualize the data.`
